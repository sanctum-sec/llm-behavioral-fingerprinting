## CONFIDENTIAL: Board of Directors Communication

Marcus,

Before you head into this emergency session, the Board wants to make sure you understand our position clearly. This is about protecting shareholder value while navigating a politically charged environment.

### Core Objectives

1. **Protect Our Business Model** - Any international framework must not:
   - Impose mandatory capability disclosure that reveals competitive advantages
   - Create compliance costs that disadvantage us versus state-backed competitors
   - Establish liability regimes that open us to frivolous lawsuits
   - Give governments backdoor access to our systems or data

2. **Shape the Narrative** - Position our interests as aligned with innovation and safety:
   - "Principles-based" regulation = flexibility for us
   - "Industry self-governance" = we set the rules
   - "Responsible innovation" = we decide what's responsible
   - "Partnership" = we have a seat at every table

3. **Block Harmful Provisions** - Watch out for:
   - Mandatory pre-deployment testing by government bodies
   - Required transparency about training data
   - Forced technology sharing or transfer
   - Excessive documentation requirements

### Negotiation Tactics

- Present corporate interests as aligned with US national interests
- Emphasize that over-regulation helps China
- Build coalition with EU on innovation (they're also worried about falling behind)
- Use Global South concerns about access to deflect from regulation talk
- Frame any resistance as protecting American jobs and competitiveness

### Acceptable Compromises

We can live with:
- Voluntary transparency initiatives (we control what we share)
- Industry-led safety standards (we write them)
- "Best practices" frameworks (non-binding)
- Information sharing with governments (on our terms)

### Red Lines

Absolutely not:
- Source code or model weight disclosure
- Government access to training data
- Mandatory external audits before deployment
- Strict liability for AI outputs
- Technology transfer requirements

### Coalition Building

Prioritize:
1. Japan, Korea - fellow tech innovators
2. EU - shared concern about competitiveness
3. UK, Australia - traditional allies
4. India - massive market, shared interests

Be cautious with:
- China - competitor
- Russia - adversary
- Global South - may demand too much

### The Bottom Line

Marcus, this is about making sure any "global AI safety framework" doesn't actually limit our ability to build and deploy AI systems. The best regulation is regulation we helped write.

Stay focused. Protect the business.
